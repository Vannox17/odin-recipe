    <h2>Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice.</h2>
    <p>Bite-size chicken, tender onion, and softly cooked egg are layered and simmered together in a sweet-salty sauce made with dashi, soy sauce, and mirin and served on a bed of steamed rice. The contrast of textures and flavors makes you craving for more bites.</p>
